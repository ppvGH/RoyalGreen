# RoyalGreen

RoyalGreen is a work-in-progress 3D simulation of a retro arcade room. Its name and some of its details are a tribute to an old arcade bar.
The application is written in C++17 and the graphic API used is OpenGL3.3 core.

# How to run the application
The fastest (and simplest) way to run the application:
